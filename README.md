<h1>Welcome To Aglink</h1>

<p>Just an idea of mine for a company to store service information and share it for farmers. possible have real time data from machinery for service reminders. Probably use react/redux and node.</p>

<p>
  Other possible Ideas going forward
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Market place with included service history. local and broard. one for parts and one for machinery.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sharing service manuals. Repair tips.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking machine hours and setting service reminders.
  </li>
  <li>
    search engine for machine data. filter data. service info.
  </li>
  <li>
    gps mapping for machine tracking. mack it easy to setup. plug and play any machine with obd2. possible setup other possiblities for tracking not sure yet.
  </li>
</ol>

## This will be slow as im still learning to code. Collabriators are welcome!
